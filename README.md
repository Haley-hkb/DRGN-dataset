# DRGN-dataset
The GNN models and the dataset used in the DRGN

## Papers

Here we provide papers that generate or analyze the four GNN models respectively. If you want to know the specific details of the three GNN models, please read the following papers：

1. **PageRank:**  [Graph neural networks for ranking Web pages](https://doi.org/10.1109/WI.2005.67)
2. **GCN for node classification:**  [Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1609.02907)
3. **GCN for graph classification:**  [How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.00826)
4. **GraphSage:** [Inductive representation learning on large graphs ](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3294771.3294869)

## Codes

This directory contains code necessary to run the GCN and GraphSage algorithm.

***Note:*** The code of the GCN model and the GraphSage model here are quoted from the open source code provided by other authors. Here we list the URL of their open source code repository, and more details can be obtained from it.
